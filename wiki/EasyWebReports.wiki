= Introduction =

Easy Web Reports framework is a combination of Client side(js) and Server side libraries(java classes) which takes care of the User Interface,async requests,database access,report rendering etc .So the developer just need to specify the queries and the magic happens .The Grid representation is powered by [http://www.dhtmlx.com] DHTMLX Library.


= Get Started =


  * Download the *gc.war* file and deploy it in your application server
  * Import the sql(MySql) file *grid.sql* to your database.You can find this file in the root folder of the application or in Downloads. 
  * Configure your database properties *"WEB-INF/classes/jdbc.properties"*.
  * Restart your application server and go to http://localhost:8080/gc to see the Demo .

= Reports Customization  =
   Before starting our reports customization,let's know about 3 important files in the application.
  * index.html ==> The view page for reports.
  * JsonService.jsp ==> Service page which returns the data as Json.
  * reportCtrl.js  ==> Is the controller page,which is responsible for handling requests,making async calls,handling responses,handling errors etc.

We've a 2 level navigation menu defined in a json called *navigationMenu* in the file *reportCtrl.js*.First level is the report Section and the second  is List of reports in that section.Change the labels of the report section and items in the section as per your needs.Each report Item will should have an unique Id.
